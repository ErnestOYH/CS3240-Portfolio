# CS3240-Portfolio
## About Me

I am a Year 3 NUS student studying CS3240, "Interaction Design".  
I took this module to learn more about user experience and on the ways to improve them.  
I will be showing my works below.  

## CS3240 Project Prototype
### Getting Started
Our group initially each have a different idea for our project pitches.  
Instead of choosing to work on one of our project pitches, we came up with the idea of improving navigation in shopping malls.

### Problem with mall navigation
- It is easy to get lost in large malls such as VivoCity and Mustafa Centre
- It takes a lot of time to look for certain shops in large malls
- It is not convenient to look for mall directory a good amount of times 

### Solution
We decided to create a restaurant navigation phone application for VivoCity  

### Reasons
- With the online shopping being available, people do not necessarily shop at malls
- Majority of people who goes to malls have their meal there

### Survey Insights
We created a survey to determine if there is merit to the problem we are tackling.  
The survey is also meant to understand users needs and preferences.

- The most popular choice is dining, so there is a need to cater our app to this larger group of Vivo visitors.
- Possible expansion outside of restaurants such as entertainment and shopping, which are also popular to-do for Vivo visitors.

- Good spreads of cuisines, implementation of promotions page can be less focused on specific cuisines and increase coverage.
- We can recommend users regarding which restaurant to go in case they are unsure what to eat.

- It seems that there is quite a high percentage of people who have issues navigating VivoCity
- Having a navigation app would likely to help a lot when navigating around VivoCity

- While the response in regards to the usage of the mall directory seems relatively mixed, more people tend not to use the mall directory.
- People might not use the mall directory either because they know how to navigate VivoCity or the mall directory is not easy to locate.

- It seems that most people do not find it either hard or easy to find the mall directory.
- As the mall directory is not very easy to locate, some people may not go out of their way to use the mall directory, which roughly matches the data we received in regards to how much mall directories are used.

-Most people find the mall directory easy to understand
-Since mall directories are relatively easy to understand for most people, if the directories can be easily accessed, more people would be using it.

<img width="800" height="400" src="https://github.com/ErnestOYH/CS3240-Portfolio/blob/master/images/VivoCity%20Qns7.png">

- A large percentage of people have used a navigation app before
- Most people have thought about using navigation app likely in hopes to resolve their navigation issues

<img width="800" height="400" src="https://github.com/ErnestOYH/CS3240-Portfolio/blob/master/images/VivoCity%20Qns8.png">

- Majority of the people finds it useful to have a navigation app to help with their navigation

#### Overall insights

Most respondents find the mall directories easy to understand and relatively harder to locate. There seems to be no visible relationship/trend on this with whether respondents use the directory or not.

Therefore, the navigation app does not have to completely replace current practices but work with and complement the directories. One gap that we can possibly work to fill is providing shop/navigation information to users when they cannot find the directories.

### Own Prototype

Each of us came up with our own prototype to decide what is best suited for the final prototype.

#### Restaurant Directory (A-Z)

## Civic Soul (Orbital, Project Gemini)

The phone application that Boo Ming Hui and I worked on is to assist university students to be able to find community work or services more easily.

### Problem
From primary school to junior college, schools have always been helping students arrange community service work to do through the use of Community Involvement Programme. At university, this may no longer be the case. We suspected that university students might have wanted to do more community work themselves but have no idea on where to look for them. In addition, organisations that arranges community service work for volunteers might have no idea on where to find these volunteers.

### Solution
We decided to create a phone application that acts as an intermediary between students and volunteer organisations.
